**ðŸ“Œ Long Division Method Steps:**

- First, bring the next digit to form the new dividend. We must always bring only one digit at a time from the original dividend.
- Only add a decimal point to the quotient when there are no more digits to bring down from the original dividend. Then, append a zero to the remainder to continue the division process.
- If the new dividend is less than the divisor, place a 0 in the quotient.
- Just after bringing down the next digit from the original dividend, we must not immediately add a decimal point in the quotient and a zero to the new dividend; instead, we should place a 0 in the quotient.
