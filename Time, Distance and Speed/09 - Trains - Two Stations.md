Two Stations type: Two trains approach from two different stations, usually from opposite directions, and eventually meet.

**Page 57:**
For the keyword "How far from X station will the trains meet?", first find the meeting Time, which is the same for both trains because they start travelling towards each other from opposite directions at the same Time. Then, calculate the Distance from station X to the meeting point using the meeting Time and the Speed of the train.

**Page 59:**
In Relative Speed type, when two trains are travelling towards each other from opposite directions and meet, but their starting Times are not given in the question, assume that they started travelling at the same Time. So, start the sum by equating with the Time (i.e., the meeting Time).

**Page 60:**
- When two objects start traveling at different Times, let the early starter cover some Distance until the late starter starts. Then treat it as a Relative Speed problem with the remaining Distance.
- For the keyword "How far from X station will the trains meet?", first find the meeting Time, which is the same for both trains because they start travelling towards each other from opposite directions at the same Time. Then, calculate the Distance from station X to the meeting point using the meeting Time and the Speed of the train.

- QR = 20 * 4 = 80 km.
- In the Meeting/Chasing type, for the chasing scenario, first focus on finding the meeting Time when the chaser catches up to the runner.
- In Relative Speed type, when two objects travel in the same direction, the faster object will always be behind the slower object, allowing the faster object to chase the slower object until both finally meet.
