- Relative Speed applies only to problems where two objects are moving towards or away from each other.
- In Relative Speed type, when two objects move in the same direction, it's a chasing scenario; whereas if they move in opposite directions, it's a meeting scenario.
- Relative Speed (Like a Magnet) 2 objects moving in the same direction → Subtract the 2 Speeds. 2 objects moving in the opposite direction → Add the 2 Speeds. Remember: (S)ame → (S)ubtract.

- In Relative Speed type, when two cases are given in the question, start the sum by equating the quantity (usually the passing distance 'D') that remains constant in both cases.
- In Relative Speed type, when a train and two men pass each other, start the sum by equating the quantity (train length) that remains constant in both cases (the train passing each man separately).

When substituting values separately into the L.H.S/R.H.S of an equation, the equation's units must be considered while solving, because the units do not cancel out with those units on the other side of the equation.

**Page 48:**
- When a train passes a non-lengthy object such as a man, tree, or pole, the passing distance D = the length of the train.
- When a train passes a lengthy object such as a bridge, platform, or another train, the passing distance D = the length of the lengthy object + the length of the train.
- When solving an equation with different units, convert all units to the specified unit in the answer.

When cancelling m/s units on both sides of an equation, the result will be in km/hr.

- When ratios are given in the question and if you need to find specific quantities, assigning a variable (e.g., 'x') to one or both parts of the ratio can help to solve the problem.
- When simplifying a number in a fraction by canceling common factors, if the next part of the number becomes too small to divide by the factor, place a zero in the quotient before continuing the simplification.

- In Relative Speed type, when two cases are given in the question, start the sum by equating the quantity (usually the passing distance 'D') that remains constant in both cases.
- In Relative Speed type, when two cases have the same passing Distance 'D', and their corresponding Time values and one Speed value are given in the question, you can find the unknown Speed by inversing the Time Ratio to get the Speed Ratio. Then, use this Speed Ratio to set up a Proportion using the Relative Speeds to find the unknown Speed. Note that one Speed value must be given in the question to find the unknown Speed.
