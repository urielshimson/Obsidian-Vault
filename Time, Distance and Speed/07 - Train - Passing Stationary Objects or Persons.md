**‚≠ê Basic Concepts**

- In trains, distance "D" is the passing distance.
- In train problems, the distance "D" value will always be in m/s, because the length of the train is measured in meters.
- Mnemonic ‚Üí Department of Science and Technology.

**Page 39:**
Use the Chain Rule to relate Distance and Time proportionally using Speed, and calculate the unknown Time.

**Page 40:**
- When a train passes a lengthy object in "X+Y" seconds, it first covers the object's length in "x" seconds, then its own length in the remaining "y" seconds.
- When a train passes a non-lengthy object like a tree/pole/person in "x" seconds, it passes it by covering its own length in "x" seconds.

**Page 42:**
If a train travels at a constant Speed and takes the same amount of Time to pass certain Distances, it means those Distances are of equal length.

**Page 43:**
- To get P% of its Original Speed: New Speed = Original Speed √ó (P / 100).
- To get P% less than its Original Speed: New Speed = Original Speed √ó (1 - P/100).

**Page 44:**
If the question has the keyword "Equal/Same/Identical", start the sum by equating the corresponding quantities.
