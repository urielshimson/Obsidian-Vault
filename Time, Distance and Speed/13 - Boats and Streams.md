- Boat Speed will always be greater than Stream Speed.
- B → Speed of the Boat in Still Water. S → Speed of the Stream.
- Downstream Speed.
- Upstream Speed.

**Page 76:**
Downstream Speed.

**Page 77:**
- Upstream Distance is equal to Downstream Distance in this problem, so the Time Ratio can be inversed to the Speed Ratio for this problem.
- The Time Ratio can be inversed to the Speed Ratio only when the Distance is constant.

**Page 78:**
- Upstream Speed.
- Downstream Speed.

**Page 79:**
Upstream Speed.

**Page 80:**
- When two cases (upstream case and downstream case) along with their respective Time values are given in the question, start the sum with Time.
- Finally, solve the equations in the denominator to find the values of b and s.
- Select an equation with an equally splittable side, assume values for b + s and b – s that make both sides of the equation equal, verify that the values of b + s and b – s satisfy both equations, and then solve by forming equations by setting b + s and b – s equal to the assumed values to find the values of b and s.

**Page 81:**
- Upstream Time > Downstream Time.
- To solve equations involving the addition or subtraction of two fractions with a single unknown in either the numerators or the denominators, you can find the value of the unknown variable 's' by substituting appropriate even or odd values and checking whether the L.H.S. = R.H.S.
- Assume a smaller value in the denominator compared to the numerator.
- If the Distance value is already given in the question, we must not start the sum by equating the Distance values for the "Same Distance" keyword.

**Page 82:**
You can't use the independent Speed formula in Boats and Streams because the boat travels either upstream or downstream.

**Page 83:**
If the question has multiple Speed values or Time values along with the "Same Distance" keyword, assume the Distance to be the LCM of those Speeds or Times. This is because, according to the formula D = S × T, the Distance must be a common multiple of the given Speeds or Times.

**Page 84:**
- When you have two fractions set equal to each other (a proportion), use cross multiplication to eliminate the denominators and find the unknown values of the variables.
- When a single equation has two unknowns, you cannot fully solve it. After partially solving, the result will be in Ratios. So, attach a variable like "x" along with the Ratios.
- When you have two fractions set equal to each other (a proportion), you can simplify the equation by canceling common factors shared by the numerators, the denominators, or a numerator and denominator on the same side of the equation (LHS or RHS).

**Page 85:**
If the equations do not have an equally splittable side, assign variables such as d and u to represent 1 / (b + s) and 1 / (b – s), substitute the variables d and u into both the equations, solve these equations to find the values of d and u, and then find the values of b and s by setting 1 / (b + s) = d and 1 / (b − s) = u.

**Page 86:**
- The Time Ratio can be inversed to the Speed Ratio only when the Distance is constant.
- Upstream Distance is not equal to Downstream Distance in this problem, so the Time Ratio cannot be inversed to the Speed Ratio for this problem.

**Page 89:**
Distance is being directly asked here, so we can't assume the Distance value for the "Same Distance" keyword.
