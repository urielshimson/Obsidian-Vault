**[[09 - Set-5 (Boats & Streams).pdf#page=2|⭐ Basic Concepts]]**

**📌 Speed Concepts**
- The speed of the **Boat** is always greater than the speed of the **Stream**.
- Let:  
  - **B** → Speed of the Boat in Still Water  
  - **S** → Speed of the Stream

**📌 Directional Keywords**
- To identify **Downstream** or **Upstream** in questions, look for these keywords:  
  - **Downstream** → Same direction as stream  
    - Keywords: **Same**, **Along**, **With the stream**  
  - **Upstream** → Opposite direction to stream  
    - Keywords: **Opposite**, **Against**, **Against the current**

**📌 Formulas**
- **Downstream Speed (DS)** = **B + S**
- **Upstream Speed (US)** = **B − S**

**🧩 Problems**

**🎯 [[09 - Set-5 (Boats & Streams).pdf#page=3|Problem 1:]]**
- Speed along the current → Downstream Speed
- Speed against the current → Upstream Speed

🎯 [[09 - Set-5 (Boats & Streams).pdf#page=4|Problem 2:]]
- From the question here, "downstream" refers to the downstream speed.

**🎯 [[09 - Set-5 (Boats & Streams).pdf#page=5|Problem 3:]]**
- The Time Ratio can be inversed to the Speed Ratio only when the Distance is constant.
- Upstream Distance is equal to Downstream Distance in this problem, so the Time Ratio can be inversed to the Speed Ratio for this problem.

**🎯 [[09 - Set-5 (Boats & Streams).pdf#page=6|Problem 4:]]**
- In TDS questions, from the three quantities Time, Distance, and Speed, if any two are given in the question and one is missing, find the missing quantity first using the other two known quantities.
- From the question here, "upstream" refers to the upstream speed, and "downstream" refers to the downstream speed.

**🎯 [[09 - Set-5 (Boats & Streams).pdf#page=7|Problem 5:]]**
Upstream Speed.
- In percentage comparisons, the original value is always treated as 100% by default.
- The original is already considered 100%, and since the question says “50% greater,” we add 50% more to it, making it 150% in total.

**🎯 [[09 - Set-5 (Boats & Streams).pdf#page=8|Problem 6:]]**
- When two cases (upstream case and downstream case) along with their respective Time values are given in the question, start the sum with Time.

💡 **Sample Value Substitution Method**: 
- If the options contain only whole numbers without fractions/decimals, and if the Time value on the LHS can be split properly or split equally, then solve the equations using the Sample Value Substitution Method.
- Start with the equation that has the smaller total time value, or one that can be split equally.
- Try values for the denominators (b+s and b-s) that make both sides of the equation balance correctly.
- Always ensure that the value of b+s is greater than the value of b-s.
- Finally, solve the two equations  b + s = ... and  b - s = ... to find the values of b and s.

💡 **Reciprocal Substitution Method**:
- If the options contain fractions/decimals, or if the Time value on the LHS cannot be split properly or split equally, then solve the equations using the Reciprocal Substitution Method.
- Let u = 1/b-s and d = 1/b+s
- Rewrite the original Time equations in terms of u and d to eliminate complex fractions.
- Solve the new equations to find the value of u and d.
- Then, take reciprocals of u and d to find the actual speeds 1/u = b-s and 1/d = b+s.
- Finally, solve the two equations b+s = ... and b-s = ... to find the values of b and s.

**🎯 [[09 - Set-5 (Boats & Streams).pdf#page=9|Problem 7:]]**
- The Time taken for the boat to travel upstream will always be greater than the Time taken for the boat to travel downstream when covering the same distance.
- To solve equations involving the addition or subtraction of two fractions with a single unknown in either the numerators or the denominators, you can find the value of the unknown variable 's' by substituting appropriate even or odd values and checking whether the L.H.S. = R.H.S.
- The Time taken for the boat to travel upstream will always be greater than the Time taken for the boat to travel downstream when covering the same Distance.

**🎯 [[09 - Set-5 (Boats & Streams).pdf#page=10|Problem 8:]]**
- In Boats and Streams, when asked to find the Speed, we cannot use the basic Speed formula S = D/T because the boat travels either upstream or downstream. So, either use the upstream or downstream formula.

**🎯 [[09 - Set-5 (Boats & Streams).pdf#page=11|Problem 9:]]**
- If the question has multiple Speed values or Time values along with the "Same Distance" keyword, assume the Distance to be the LCM of those Speeds or Times. This is because, according to the formula D = S × T, the Distance must be a common multiple of the given Speeds or Times.

**🎯 [[09 - Set-5 (Boats & Streams).pdf#page=12|Problem 10:]]**
- When you have two fractions set equal to each other (a proportion), use cross multiplication to eliminate the denominators and find the unknown values of the variables.
- When you have two fractions set equal to each other (a proportion), you can simplify the equation by canceling common factors shared by the numerators, the denominators, or a numerator and denominator on the same side of the equation (LHS or RHS).
- When a single equation has two unknowns, you cannot fully solve it. After partially solving, the result will be in Ratios. So, attach a variable like "x" along with the Ratios.

💡 **Reciprocal Substitution Method**:
- If the options contain fractions/decimals, or if the Time value on the LHS cannot be split properly or split equally, then solve the equations using the Reciprocal Substitution Method.
- Let u = 1/b-s and d = 1/b+s
- Rewrite the original Time equations in terms of u and d to eliminate complex fractions.
- Solve the new equations to find the value of u and d.
- Then, take reciprocals of u and d to find the actual speeds 1/u = b-s and 1/d = b+s.
- Finally, solve the two equations b+s = ... and b-s = ... to find the values of b and s.

🎯 [[09 - Set-5 (Boats & Streams).pdf#page=14|Problem 12:]]
- The Time Ratio can be inversed to the Speed Ratio only when the Distance is constant.
- Upstream Distance is not equal to Downstream Distance in this problem, so the Time Ratio cannot be inversed to the Speed Ratio for this problem.

- If the question has the keyword "Equal/Same/Identical", start the sum by equating the corresponding quantities. 
- When you have two fractions set equal to each other (a proportion), use cross multiplication to eliminate the denominators and find the unknown values of the variables.
- When you have two fractions set equal to each other (a proportion), you can simplify the equation by canceling common factors shared by the numerators, the denominators, or a numerator and denominator on the same side of the equation (LHS or RHS).

**🎯 [[09 - Set-5 (Boats & Streams).pdf#page=17|Problem 15:]]**
- Distance is being directly asked here, so we can't assume the Distance value by taking the LCM of those Speed values for the "Same Distance" keyword.
- If the question says it takes 'x' hours more or less time in one direction than the other direction to cover the same Distance, use the Time difference equation to solve the problem.
- If the question has the keyword "Equal/Same/Identical", start the sum by equating the corresponding quantities.

✅ Rounding Rule:
- If the number after the decimal point is 5 or more → Round up to the next whole number.
- If the number after the decimal point is less than 5 → Round down to the same whole number.
