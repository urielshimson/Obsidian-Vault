**âœ… Relative Speed â€“ Key Concept**
- Relative Speed applies only to problems where two objects are moving towards or away from each other.
- In relative speed problems, when two objects move in the same direction, it's called a chasing scenario. When they move in opposite directions, it's called a meeting scenario.

**âœ… Relative Speed (Like a Magnet)**
- 2 objects moving in the same direction â†’ Subtract the 2 Speeds. 
- 2 objects moving in the opposite direction â†’ Add the 2 Speeds.
- Remember: (**S**)ame â†’ (**S**)ubtract

- For linear race type problems, solve them using the equation method.
- The arrow marks in the equations represent the word "covers".
- The winner takes less time to finish the race than the loser.
- Since Vishuâ€™s speed is constant in both cases, we can subtract the two equations.

- LCM of lap times â†’ To find the first meeting time at the starting point, when both runners have completed whole laps and therefore meet simultaneously. It is because LCM is the smallest time that is a multiple of both individual lap times.
- Relative speed â†’ To find the first meeting time anywhere on the track, not necessarily at the starting point.
