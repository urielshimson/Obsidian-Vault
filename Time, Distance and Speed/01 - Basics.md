**ðŸ“Œ [[01 - SET-1 (TDS problems) Part 1.pdf#page=1|1. Formula]]**
- Speed = Distance / Time
- Distance = Speed Ã— Time 
- Time = Distance / Speed

**ðŸ“Œ [[01 - SET-1 (TDS problems) Part 1.pdf#page=1|2. Relationships Between Speed, Distance, and Time]]**
- When **Speed** is constant, Distance and Time are *Directly Proportional*  
  â†’ D = S Ã— T (or) T = D / S
- When **Distance** is constant, Speed and Time are *Inversely Proportional*  
  â†’ T = D / S (or) S = D / T
- When **Time** is constant, Distance and Speed are *Directly Proportional*  
  â†’ D = S Ã— T (or) S = D / T

**ðŸ“Œ 3. Rules for Unit Conversion**
- To convert from a **larger unit to a smaller unit**, use a fraction with a **smaller numerator**
  â†’ (e.g., km/h to m/s â†’ multiply by **5/18**).
- To convert from a **smaller unit to a larger unit**, use a fraction with a **larger numerator**
  â†’ (e.g., m/s to km/h â†’ multiply by **18/5**)

**ðŸŽ¯ [[01 - SET-1 (TDS problems) Part 1.pdf#page=2|Problem 1:]]**
- To convert from a larger unit to a smaller unit, use a fraction with a smaller numerator (e.g., km/h to m/s â†’ multiply by 5/18).

**ðŸŽ¯ [[01 - SET-1 (TDS problems) Part 1.pdf#page=3|Problem 2:]]**
- To convert from a smaller unit to a larger unit, use a fraction with a larger numerator (e.g., m/s to km/h â†’ multiply by 18/5).

**ðŸŽ¯ [[01 - SET-1 (TDS problems) Part 1.pdf#page=5|Problem 3:]]**
- Use the Chain Rule to relate Time and Distance proportionally using Speed, and calculate the unknown Distance.

**ðŸŽ¯ [[01 - SET-1 (TDS problems) Part 1.pdf#page=9|Problem 7:]]**
- If the question has multiple Speed values or Time values along with the "Same Distance" keyword, assume the Distance to be the LCM of those Speeds or Times. This is because, according to the formula D = S Ã— T, the Distance must be a common multiple of the given Speeds or Times.
- Inversing the Speed Ratio to find Time Ratio works only for two Ratios. For three Ratios, you must first calculate the Distance value from the Speed Ratios, and then find out the Time Ratio from the Distance value and the Speed Ratios.

**ðŸŽ¯ [[01 - SET-1 (TDS problems) Part 1.pdf#page=11|Problem 9:]]**
- If there are 41 telephone poles, the Distance between them is 40.

**ðŸŽ¯ [[01 - SET-1 (TDS problems) Part 1.pdf#page=12|Problem 10:]]**
- If the question has the keyword "Same/Equal/Identical", start the sum by equating the corresponding quantities.
